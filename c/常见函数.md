```c
// 1) Copies the value (unsigned char)ch into each of the first count characters of the object pointed to by dest.
// The behavior is undefined if access occurs beyond the end of the dest array. 
// The behavior is undefined if dest is a null pointer.
void *memset( void *dest, int ch, size_t count );

// Writes every character from the null-terminated string str 
// and one additional newline character '\n' to the output stream stdout, as if by repeatedly executing fputc.
// The terminating null character from str is not written.
// Parameters
// str	-	character string to be written
// Return value
// On success, returns a non-negative value
// On failure, returns EOF and sets the error `indicator` (see ferror()) on stream.
int puts(const char *str); // 返回strlen + 1 例如 "" return 1
